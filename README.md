# Chat / Socket.io
An app that allows people to chat back and forth using socket.io and node.js.

## Installing
Use Terminal for Mac or GitBash for PC.

- install node.js
- install socket.io
- install express

## Requirements
The requirements are to create a chatting app with interactive abilities and fully design the app. The app should have more than the basic functionalities done in class.

## Testing
Terminal (one window for regular terminal, one for dealing with the server) was used to test this app. Multiple browsers to talk back and forth were also used for this project.
